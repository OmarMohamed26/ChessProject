/**
 * move.c
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Execute piece movement between cells on the GameBoard.
 * - Provide a helper to clear a cell's piece data and release associated texture.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - These functions operate directly on the global GameBoard array (declared in main.c).
 * - Textures are managed with raylib's LoadTexture/UnloadTexture APIs; callers must ensure
 *   proper sizing/assignment (LoadPiece is used to place textures on destination squares).
 * - All operations are intended to be called from the main thread.

/**
 * MovePiece
 *
 * Move a piece from an initial board square to a final board square.
 *
 * Behavior / Side effects:
 * - Loads the moving piece's texture into the destination cell via LoadPiece().
 * - Marks the destination piece as having moved (hasMoved = 1).
 * - Clears the source cell by calling SetEmptyCell(), which also unloads any texture
 *   that remained on the source.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - initialRow, initialCol : source coordinates (0..7)
 *  - finalRow, finalCol     : destination coordinates (0..7)
 *
 * Preconditions / Safety:
 * - This function assumes GameBoard[initialRow][initialCol].piece.type is valid.

/**
 * SetEmptyCell
 *
 * Clear a Cell to represent an empty square and release any associated texture.
 *
 * Behavior / Side effects:
 * - Sets piece.type to PIECE_NONE and resets piece-related flags (hasMoved, enPassant).
 * - Resets piece.team to TEAM_WHITE as a neutral default.
 * - If a Texture2D is present (texture.id != 0) it is UnloadTexture()'d to free GPU memory.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - cell: pointer to the Cell to clear (must be non-NULL).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Safe to call on already-empty cells; UnloadTexture will not be called when texture.id == 0.
